# Hello Hi SalamuAlaikum ! I'm Kawtar Taïk 

Lazy software engineering student, hardcore Java user, unapologetic Linux advocate.

### What do I do in my free time ? 
- Mostly weaseling (it's very real, ask me about it!)
- Starting projects and never finishing them

### Let's connect (only contact me if you have snacks to offer)!  
I would love to work together, make sure to contact me if you do too:
